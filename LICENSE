"Basically, we are of the opinion that all our data should be in the public domain. 
However, this is not possible (in many countries, you cannot abandon your copyright).
So, we had to choose a license, and we selected what looked like the most free ones. 
But still, we are happy whenever anybody wants to reuse our data. If you are unsure 
whether you can reuse our data in your project, just ask (the answer will probably 
be "yes, you can!"). Using our work for commercial purposes is also permitted."
